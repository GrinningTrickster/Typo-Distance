This program contains a function called typoDistance, which takes in two strings
as arguments.  This function finds the typo distance between the two strings,
which is the likelihood that the second string is a typo of the first, as
measured by a floating point number.  The lower the number, the more likely it
is that the second string is a typo of the first.

Thus, for instance, "rlephants" is a fairly likely typo of "elephants" on a
QWERTY keyboard, since R is fairly close to E, but "ilephants" is a less likely
typo, and therefore would have a higher score.
